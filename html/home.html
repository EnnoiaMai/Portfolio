                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Thuc Nguyen, but I also go by Ennoia. I graduated from UCSD in 2017 with a Human Biology major. During the years as an undergraduate, I grew a strong interest in Computer Science and started learning how to program offhand. I looked into C++ as my first programming language to gain some fundamental understanding of how to code. Thereafter, I sought to learn a multitude of languages and coded some mobile applications along the way. I was never able to fully complete and publish an app. The only classes I took during my undergrad years included an Introduction to Java class and a Basic Data Structures class. Despite my lack of a formal education in this field, I am motivated to pursue C.S. and complete as many projects as I can. This is my life's work.</p>

                        <h3>Languages and Syntax</h3>
                        <p>The syntax for all of the languages that I have learned so far. Each particular page includes code snippets that I have found useful for understanding the language. I try to summarize what I've learned and read from various sites that contain the documentation, so these pages act more as notes and as a reference rather than a coverage of all the capabilities of the language. These notes also use code blocks from Youtube videos as examples.</p>
